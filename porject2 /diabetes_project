🩺 Diabetes Prediction Project
📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
We used different classification models and tuned their hyperparameters to find the best performance.

📂 Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle / sklearn datasets)

Features:

Pregnancies

Glucose

BloodPressure

SkinThickness

Insulin

BMI

DiabetesPedigreeFunction

Age

Target: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

🛠 Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values.

Replaced zero values in some columns with the mean or median.

Applied scaling using StandardScaler to normalize data.

🔍 Models Used
We tried multiple classifiers and tuned them using GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters:

1️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Best Parameters: n_neighbors=7, weights='uniform', metric='minkowski'

Accuracy: XX%

2️⃣ Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Best Parameters: C=1, kernel='rbf', gamma='scale'

Accuracy: XX%

3️⃣ Random Forest Classifier
Best Parameters: n_estimators=100, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2

Accuracy: XX%

📊 Model Evaluation
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
KNN	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
SVC	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
RandomForest	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%

Confusion Matrix:
Visualized for each model to compare performance.

📈 Conclusion
The best performing model was: SVC / RandomForest (based on accuracy and F1-score).

Feature scaling was essential for SVC and KNN performance.

RandomForest handled unscaled data well but performed slightly better after scaling.
