# 🐉 Game of Thrones Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a character from the TV series **Game of Thrones** will survive or not, based on various attributes from the `character-predictions.csv` dataset (Kaggle).  
The dataset contains information about characters' house affiliations, titles, culture, and other features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for machine learning.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data.
- Engineer new features that improve model performance.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models.
- Compare results and select the best-performing model.

## 📊 Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Remove irrelevant columns.  
   - Encode categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Correlation analysis.  
   - Distribution plots and histograms.  
   - Insights into survival patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge.  
   - Scale/normalize numerical features.

4. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
   - Confusion matrix visualization.
